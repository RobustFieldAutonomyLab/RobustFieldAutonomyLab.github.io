<p style="text-align: justify;"> Dr. Brendan Englot received S.B., S.M. and Ph.D. degrees in Mechanical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2007, 2009 and 2012, 
respectively. At MIT, he studied motion planning for surveillance and inspection applications, deploying his algorithms on an underwater robot to inspect 
Navy and Coast Guard ships. During 2012-2014, Brendan was with United Technologies Research Center in East Hartford, Connecticut, where he was a Research 
Scientist and Principal Investigator in the Autonomous and Intelligent Robotics Laboratory and a technical contributor to the Sikorsky Autonomous Research 
Aircraft. He joined Stevens as an Assistant Professor in 2014, and is currently a tenured Associate Professor. Brendan is the recipient of a 2017 NSF CAREER award and a 
2020 ONR Young Investigator award. In 2018, he was appointed the Geoffrey S. Inman Endowed 
Junior Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Stevens Institute of Technology.
