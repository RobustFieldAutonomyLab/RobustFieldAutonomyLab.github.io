<p style="text-align: justify;">Dr. Brendan Englot received S.B., S.M.
and Ph.D. degrees in Mechanical Engineering from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in 2007, 2009 and 2012, respectively. At MIT,
he studied path planning for surveillance and inspection applications,
deploying his algorithms on an underwater inspection robot that was
produced in quantity for the US Navy.&nbsp;Brendan joined Stevens
in Fall 2014 from the United Technologies Research Center in East
Hartford, Connecticut, where he was a Research Scientist and Principal
Investigator in the Autonomous and Intelligent Robotics Laboratory
(AIRLab) and a technical contributor to the Sikorsky Autonomous
Research Aircraft (SARA). While at United Technologies, Brendan was
also a part-time lecturer in the Department of Mechanical Engineering
at Yale University, where he taught mechatronics in 2013 and 2014.
Brendan is the recipient of a 2017 NSF CAREER award. In 2018, he was
appointed the Geoffrey S. Inman Endowed Junior Professor of Mechanical
Engineering. (<a href="http://web.stevens.edu/facultyprofile/?id=2043">Link to Stevens faculty webpage</a>)<br></p><br><h2>Ph.D. Students</h2><br><div style="padding: 10px 0pt; float: left;"><img style="width: 180px; height: 201px;" alt="" src="./people_files/frankie_photo.jpg">&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
